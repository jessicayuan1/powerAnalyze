[Study on BESS failures] -- analysis of faulure root cause 
Charging stopped by external parties l-- already has features built in to lock the port 

this is what I researched, this is what I learned, I can apply this here, and it would make your company more efficient. Working in prev I saw how energy was wasted and how there were emergency procedures in place like UPS systems and inadequate cooling.


BESS failures linked to design, manufacturing, integratoin and operation phases of a projectm and while codes, standard, and expertise serve as mitigation, there is gap is safety practices in integratio nand operation phases. the engineer
Understanding reasons behind battery stogae is critical for preventing them, and created this new framework for classifying failure incidents.
This only emphasizes the importance of battery analytics, with most of the fail
